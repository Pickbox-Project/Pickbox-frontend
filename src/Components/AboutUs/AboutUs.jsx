            Pickbox is a cutting-edge technology enabled market-to-doorstep
            logistics startup that was established in 2023 as an innovative
            means to providing easy, convenient, and reliable package delivery
            service from merchants in markets to their customers' doorsteps. Our
            app eliminates the hassles of individuals (end-users) spending hours
            in exhausting commutes, endless waiting for commercial drivers, and
            paying unwarranted charges to storekeepers in major motor parks in
            every city by providing door-step delivery as a premium alternative.
