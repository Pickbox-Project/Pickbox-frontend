            Pickbox is a cutting-edge technology enabled market-to-doorstep
            <br />
            logistics startup that was established in 2023 as an innovative
            means to providing
            <br /> easy, convenient, and reliable package delivery service from
            merchants in markets <br />
            to their customers' doorsteps. Our app eliminates the hassles of
            individuals <br />
            (end-users) spending hours in exhausting commutes, endless waiting
            for
            <br />
            commercial drivers, and paying unwarranted charges to storekeepers
            in major <br />
            motor parks in every city by providing door-step delivery as a
            premium alternative.
